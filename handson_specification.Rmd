# PK analytical solution

- One-compartment PK model, with first-order absorption
  - Parameters
    - Clearance
    - Volume
    - Absorption rate constant
  - Compartments
    - Depot or absorption compartment
    - Central compartment
- Output: concentration in the central compartment


# PK with odes

- Same model, but implemented with ODE

# Add a covariate

- Make CL a function of WT
- Make volume a function of categorical covariate

# Add subject-level random effects 

- Put IIV on CL and V
- What about IOV?

# Add a residual error model

- Exponential error
- Make a function of covariate


# Add a PD model

- Some sort of IRM perhaps?
